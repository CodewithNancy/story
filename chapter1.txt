Far away, in crude land, surrounded by forests, rivers, and inhabited by animals, birds there lived four young people away from human or civilizedf life. the four people happened to be in that location by chance. Two boys and two girls wearing simple clothes which they might have made from materials found in nature around them. Their house is a hut  they build from wood and earth. their weapons are made from stone.
Does this remind you of a certain age we read about in history.
